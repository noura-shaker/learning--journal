# *The Command Line:*

The command line is a text interface for your computer. It’s a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer’s operating system to run.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OS. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.

Here’s an appendix of commonly used commands.

## shell:

Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. 
This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.
There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. 
This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.

use a command called echo to display a system variable stating your current shell. 
echo is a command which is used to display messages.
