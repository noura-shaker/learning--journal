# introduction and script:
 
 javascript: is tell us how to control the interaction of your web page.

 *JavaScript Display Possibilities*

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

1. Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML. 
2. Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
3. Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
4. Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

The <script> Tag
In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

**Scripts contain very precise instructions**

# expression and JavaScript Operators:
 
 An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be
given a value. As you have seen, this is done using
the assignment operator (the equals sign).
var color = 'beige';
The value of co 1 or is now beige.

2.EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
You can perform operations on any number of
individual values (see next page) to determine a
single value. For example:
var area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6. 
  
 **opreators**
 1. The addition operator (+) adds numbers 

 2. The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

3. The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.

4. The division operator (/) divides numbers.

5. The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder.

6. The increment operator (++) increments numbers.

7. The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.

7. The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.


 # functios:
  Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

 *functon syntax:*

 function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3){
     sta1
     sta2 
     .
     .
     return ;
 }

*Function Return*
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"
