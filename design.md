# *HTML and design:*

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the primary building block of creating a 
website. HTML is a very basic markup language and requires memorization of a 
few dozen HTML commands that structure the look and layout of a web page. Before 
writing any HTML code or designing your first web page
 you must decide on an HTML editor or text editor, such as Notepad or WordPad.

Once you have obtained an HTML editor and are ready to begin setting up your 
website, think about how you want the site to look and be set up.
 Consider even drawing out your ideas, to help visualize the site 
 and pages on the site. Below are some considerations to think about
  when designing your web page.

  # *Writing basic :*
The above code is a  very basic example of the code that helps make up every web page.
 As you can see, the code starts with <html>, which is defining that everything within <html> is HTML code.
      Next, you have <head>, which is defining the heading of your HTML document. Third, we have the <title> section
           within <head>, which defines the web page title that is displayed at the top of the Internet browser window. 
               Finally, the <body> section contains what is shown on the web page.

Below is additional code that can be placed in the <body> section of the code
    
    to help familiarize you with some of the most commonly used HTML commands.

     *WireFrames*:

     A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

# Html5 Layout:

  HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already
